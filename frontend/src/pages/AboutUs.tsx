              <p className="mb-6">
                At the conclusion of our first year of engineering, as final exams ended, weâ€”a team of four passionate software engineering students (Swagata Mandal, Soham Mangal, Sougata Kundu, and Sayam Barman)â€”chose to dedicate our 1.5-month summer break to building something impactful and practical. United by a shared vision, we brainstormed and decided to develop a Resume Builder websiteâ€”a comprehensive, full-stack platform designed to empower users to generate professional resumes using modern, clean templates, customize resume content with ease, and host and share their resumes online instantly. We began by strengthening our skills in React, backend technologies, and API development through online resources. Leveraging our individual strengths, we divided responsibilities: Swagata led the frontend and contributed to backend API integration, Sayan enhanced the frontend with responsive design and user experience improvements, Soham managed backend logic and database integration, and Sougata is developing upcoming AI-powered features for smarter resume generation. This project marked our first real-world full-stack collaboration. We gained invaluable experienceâ€”far beyond what tutorials could offerâ€”by solving real challenges, collaborating closely, and delivering features as a unified team. We are proud of our accomplishments and excited to share our work with you. Your feedback is always welcome as we continue to grow and enhance our platform. Stay tuned for our GitHub repository and live demo!
